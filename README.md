# Software Guidelines

A comprehensive collection of software engineering principles and practices that emphasize tactical programming, module design, and test-driven development.

## Overview

This repository documents the software design philosophy and Java code of conduct that governs disciplined, maintainable, and robust software engineering.

## Contents

- **SOFTWARE_PHYLOSOPHY.md** — Core design principles including design thinking, module depth, complexity management, and error elimination
- **JAVA_CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** — Java-specific behavioral rules covering exception handling, resource management, documentation, TDD, and architecture

## Key Principles

- **Design Twice** — Think before coding; validate design before implementation
- **Deep Modules** — Hide complexity behind minimal, powerful interfaces
- **Tactical Programming** — Code with clear intent and measurable objectives
- **Test-Driven Development** — Always start with a failing test
- **Error Prevention** — Design systems to eliminate invalid states rather than handle errors
- **No Information Leakage** — Expose only what's necessary; keep internals private

## Quick Start

Read the documents in order:
1. Start with **SOFTWARE_PHYLOSOPHY.md** for foundational design principles
2. Follow with **JAVA_CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** for practical Java implementation rules

These guidelines are not rules to follow blindly—they are a way of thinking about software engineering.
